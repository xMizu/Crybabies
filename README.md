# Crybaby

A minigame created with the intent to complain. 

# Motivation

We wanted to create a multiplayer game in a group setting that would be a) fun b) build relationship between players. The one thing that seemed to connect one another was the share amount of things one can complain about. 

# Getting Started

clone the repo, and `bundle install` the dependencies, after you can run the applicaiton which would show you the login screen.
